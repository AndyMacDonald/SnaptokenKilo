# SnaptokenKilo
I work through building a clone of the [Kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) editor using the [tutorial on Snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

# Differences from tutorial
* Put kilo.c in a src directory
* Function names in c_underscore_style rather than in camel case.
* To send page up and page down keycodes needed in step 50, had to bind keys in the terminal program on my MacBook as per [this page](https://fplanque.com/dev/mac/mac-osx-terminal-page-up-down-home-end-of-line).
