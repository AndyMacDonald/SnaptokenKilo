# SnaptokenKilo
I work through building a clone of the [Kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) editor using the [tutorial on Snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

# Differences from tutorial
* Put kilo.c in a src directory
* Function names in c_underscore_style rather than in camel case.
